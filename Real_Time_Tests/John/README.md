Here is where John will put his examples.  Make sure to mention how to get it running and how it is expandable!

I'm currently working on this tutorial: https://solved4u.weebly.com/matlab-solidworks-adams-tutorials/object-tracking-in-matlab-using-webcam

It seems pretty neat, and it also could allow expansion through the form of different colored objects, better detection, labeling, etc.  You need to download some drivers to get it working though, and I haven't fully gotten it working yet.  However, it doesn't seem too hard, and the video walks you through pretty easily.  The code is also provided.  I will post the code up once I've gotten it working, but that might not be till tomorrow.
